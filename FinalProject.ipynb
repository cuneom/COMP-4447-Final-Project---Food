    "\n",
    "Some of the columns that we expect to use in the analysis contain data type errors such as text instead of numeric. These records will need to be addressed with code to determine if a numeric substring exists and is within the distrubition of the other values.\n",

    "There are multiple responses where text responses were given to numeric questions; the last question asking weight has responses like \"I don't want to answer\", nan, or lists unit for lbs. Likewise, throughout the data, nan, nun, and None are all used synonymously for failure to collect responses or missing entries."
